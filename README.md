# esx_busses

This is a script that will spawn busses and let them drive a specified route.
It's buggy, like really really buggy!
But if you'd like to use and maybe fix it, you're free to do.

Tbh: I haven't used a single piece from ESX in this script I just felt like naming it after it, because it was its original purpose.
